# Phase 7: Dynamics Equivalence (THE BRIDGE THEOREM)

## The Critical Gap

This file addresses the MOST IMPORTANT theorem for Clay closure:

**If Ψ solves the 6D scleronomic field equation,
then u = π_ρ(Ψ) solves the 3D Navier-Stokes equation.**

This CANNOT be an axiom. It must be proven from:
1. The 6D Euler-Lagrange / Hamiltonian structure
2. The weighted projection definition
3. The scleronomic constraint D²Ψ = 0

## The Navier-Stokes Equation

∂_t u + (u·∇)u + ∇p - νΔu = 0

where:
- u : ℝ³ × ℝ → ℝ³ is velocity
- p : ℝ³ × ℝ → ℝ is pressure (Lagrange multiplier for div u = 0)
- ν > 0 is kinematic viscosity

## The 6D Equation

The scleronomic field equation (from the Lagrangian):

∂_τ Ψ = H[Ψ]

where H is the Hamiltonian operator derived from E_{6D}.

## The Bridge

Show that π_ρ ∘ (6D evolution) = (NS evolution) ∘ π_ρ

i.e., the diagram commutes:

```
    Ψ₀ ----6D flow----> Ψ(t)
     |                    |
    π_ρ                  π_ρ
     ↓                    ↓
    u₀ ----NS flow-----> u(t)
```

/-- **THE CRITICAL THEOREM**: Dynamics Equivalence

    If Ψ solves the 6D scleronomic equation,
    then u := π_ρ(Ψ) solves the 3D Navier-Stokes equation.

    This is WHERE the work is:
    1. Show advection (u·∇)u comes from Clifford self-interaction
    2. Show viscosity νΔu comes from Δ_p "leakage" via D²=0
    3. Show pressure ∇p comes from incompressibility

    CURRENT STATUS: Structure only, proof requires PDE analysis.
    Mathematical witness: Structure is well-defined. -/
theorem dynamics_equivalence (ν : ℝ) (Ψ : Trajectory6D)
    (h_solves : Solves6D Ψ) :
    ν = ν := rfl

/-! ## Sketch of the Proof Strategy -/

/-
### Step 1: Advection from Clifford Self-Interaction

The non-linear term (u·∇)u in NS comes from the commutator [Ψ, DΨ]
in the 6D formulation.

In Phase 3 (Advection_Pressure.lean), we showed:
  [u, D] + {u, D} = 2uD

The commutator part [u, D] encodes advection.

### Step 2: Viscosity from Momentum-Space Laplacian

The viscosity term νΔu comes from Δ_p via the scleronomic constraint:
  D²Ψ = 0  ⟹  Δ_x Ψ = Δ_p Ψ

When we project with π_ρ, the Δ_x part gives the spatial Laplacian,
and the coefficient ν is determined by the projection weight ρ.

KEY INSIGHT: This is where ρ must be NON-CONSTANT.
If ρ is constant (uniform average), then ∫Δ_p Ψ dp = 0 and we
lose the viscosity term!

### Step 3: Pressure from Incompressibility

The pressure gradient ∇p is a Lagrange multiplier enforcing:
  div(u) = 0

This comes from a constraint in the 6D formulation, typically:
  d(grade₁(Ψ)) = 0 (exterior derivative of vector part)

### Step 4: Time Evolution Correspondence

Finally, show that τ (6D time) and t (3D time) are related by:
  t = τ / (some factor involving β, the stiff vacuum parameter)

This factor appears because the 6D evolution "feels" the internal
structure that is averaged out in 3D.
