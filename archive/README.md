# Archive Directory

This directory contains historical files that are **not part of the main build** but are preserved for reference.

## Contents

### `blueprints/`
Draft Lean code from early Paper 3 development. Contains sorries and axioms that were superseded by the final implementation in `Phase7_Density/`.

**Note**: These files are NOT compiled by `lake build`.

### `latex/`
LaTeX source and PDF documents:
- `CMI_Monograph.tex/pdf` - Full monograph draft
- `CMI_Paper2_TopologicalExistence.tex/pdf` - Paper 2 draft

### `notes/`
Working notes and brainstorming documents from development.

### `old_docs/`
Superseded markdown documentation:
- `Complete_Lean_NSE_Paper2.md` - Old Paper 2 status
- `Complete_Lean_NSE_Paper3.md` - Old Paper 3 status
- `DEPENDENCY_DAG.md` - Old dependency tracking
- `RECOVERY_STATUS.md` - Old recovery notes
- `PAPER3_COMPLETION_CHECKLIST.md` - Completed checklist

## Why Archived?

These files were moved to archive on 2026-01-14 during project consolidation to:
1. Keep the main directory clean
2. Preserve historical context
3. Separate draft code (with sorries) from the verified build

## Current Documentation

See the main directory for current docs:
- `README.md` - Project overview and statistics
